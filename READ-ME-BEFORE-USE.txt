- This is a simple Chat App which is built entirely using React. The communication can be done via tabs in the browser(consider each tab as a separate user).
- Best viewed in Google Chrome.
- Use new tabs, enter same link to login and create users. The new users will only be present for messaging when you use new tabs for logging in else 
  it'll show empty.
- Remember to logout before closing tab or it'll malfunction. In case of malfunction:- open app, then open developer tools(ctrl+shift+I) and then go to console 
  and type localStorage.clear() and at last reload webpage.
